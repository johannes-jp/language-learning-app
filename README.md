# language-learning-app

**Spaced repetition and linguistic databases integrated with chat gpt for language learning**

### Concept
Take a word from the dictionary. It doesn't have a definition, it has a meaningful relationship with an informative sentence. If you think of both the word and the sentence as unique pieces of content, then generalizing the problem of language learning becomes the practice of curating relationships between content items. This tool should be a reflection of that idea.

WikiData takes a similar approach and would benefit from user contributions to its lexeme project, so I'm aiming to make integration easy for data donations. For the time being, this space will probably be geared around words & sentences with their definitions/translations for my learning purposes. But over time, I would like to manifest the idea that a userbase empowered to create and curate their own content relationships can spontaneously interlink concepts in useful and interesting ways - especially across language barriers.

Large language models like GPT will fit into the picture to help users ideate, converse, and self-correct, hopefully with some powerful functions to holistically guide learning thanks to embeddings and graph dbs. But their limitations with uncommon languages represent why it matters to have a self-determining social network - one that can create rich enough contextual links as to bridge the cultural and linguistic chasms to these tools.
