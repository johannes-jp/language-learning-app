# language-learning-app

## spaced repetition and linguistic databases integrated with chat gpt for language learning

### Intro
Take a word from the dictionary. It doesn't have a definition, it has a meaningful relationship with an informative sentence. If you think of both the word and the sentence as unique pieces of content, then generalizing the problem of 'language learning' becomes the practice of curating relationships between content items.

This tool should be a reflection of that idea. So even though it's going to be mostly words & sentences with their definitions/translations for my learning purposes, it will be designed around those relationships, and the idea that a userbase empowered to create and curate them can spontaneously interlink concepts in useful and interesting ways, especially across language barriers.

Large language models like GPT will fit into the picture to help users ideate, converse, and self-correct, but their limitations with smaller languages represent why the final form of this project should include a well-networked database with vector embeddings. Those neural networks can't serve the few and far between without us building the synapses first.
